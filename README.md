This project is to help the Dementia Patient to do their daily routine work without hassle and tension. 
Living with dementia can be challengingâ€”not just for those experiencing it, but for their loved ones too. Thatâ€™s where the AI Dementia Care Assistant steps in.
It as a kind and patient companion, always ready to gently remind and help users to track important tasks, like taking medication, drinking water, or attending an appointment, 
thus reducing confusion and anxiety.
If you ever feel lost at home, it can guide you to the kitchen, bedroom, or bathroom with simple voice instructions. And when you need a little reassurance, itâ€™s there to talk to you in a familiar, comforting voice.

Designed with care and empathy, this AI assistant isnâ€™t just about technologyâ€”itâ€™s about bringing peace of mind, fostering independence, and easing the burden on caregivers. 
Whether youâ€™re living alone, with family, or in a care facility, itâ€™s a gentle helping hand to make each day a little easier.

Because everyone deserves to feel safe, supported, and heard. ðŸ’™
